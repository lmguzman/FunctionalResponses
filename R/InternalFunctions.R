##       attack
# This is a function that models the attack rate. Input is b, N and q.
# b is what is typically known as the attack rate per capita. N is the density.
#In this case the attack rate is not linear but is dependent on N.
#Parameter q determines the type of the functional response.
#When q = 0, Nq = 1 and the attack rate is the same regardless of prey density,
#so the equation pro- duces a Type II functional response (Hammill et al., 2010b).
#When q > 0, a Type III curve is produced as the attack rate is multiplied by Nq and so increases with prey density (Hammill et al., 2010b).


attack <- function(b,q,N) {
  b*N^q
}

####   grafun
#This function models a type II or III functional response depending on what q is
# THis function does not consider that depletion may occur

gradfun <- function(t,y,parms) {
  with(as.list(c(y,parms)),
       { A  <- attack(b,q,N)
       grad <- -A*N/(1+A*h*N)
       list(grad,NULL)
       })
}

####    fun2
#Using numerical integration, we obtain the values of prey eaten when depletion occurs
#that is, when prey are not being replaced throughout the experiment

fun2 <- function(b,q,h,T, P,N0) {
  require(deSolve)
  L <- lsoda(c(N=N0),
             times=c(0,T),
             func=gradfun,
             parms=c(b=b,q=q,h=h,P=P))
  N.final <- L[2,2]
  N0-N.final

## Likelyhood function for one treatment scenario

  - sum(dbinom(Killed, prob = prop.exp, size = Initial,
               log = TRUE))

  ## NOTE ### here the parameters are not the same as before!!!
  ## IMPORTANT -- the parameters are the actual values, not the usual for R
